# Infinite Scroll

A terminal workspace manager for macOS. Organize multiple terminals in an infinitely scrollable canvas instead of switching between tabs.

## Features

- Grid layout with rows and cells of terminal panels
- Infinite vertical scrolling (`Cmd+Scroll`)
- Adjustable `Cmd+Scroll` speed
- Keyboard-driven navigation (`Cmd+Arrows`)
- Tmux-backed session persistence
- Terminal.app-style file drag-and-drop and paste (inserts shell-escaped absolute paths)
- Inline markdown notes per row
- Auto-saved workspace state
- Agent task queue with process-tree provider detection

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- tmux

## Install

Download the latest DMG from [infinite-scroll.dev](https://infinite-scroll.dev).

Or build from source:

```
swift build
```

## Agent Queue

Use the right sidebar to queue a task, choose a provider, and start it in a
dedicated worker terminal. Codex, Claude, Gemini, and Aider are recognized from
the tmux process tree; the app does not capture terminal output or prompts to
derive a status.

Process presence means an agent is active. When a process exits, its task is
blocked for your review rather than being marked complete automatically. Queue
state is saved separately from the workspace layout in `~/.infinite-scroll/`.
